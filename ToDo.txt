? 	O	ArenaUI - unit frames

	O	Frame Borders à la Beautycase, requested by gamemaster128, 11.03.10
		- Is there a way to get Skinner to create borders the way in which !Beautycase makes them? Maybe even using its CreateBorder function?

	I	Ara Broker Tradeskills & StatusBar textures, reported by X-buZZ, 15.03.10/27.03.10
		- when using the skinner default settings, the border display fine for me but the status bar texture setting is ignored. Just change the status (glaze?) bar texture to something other than the default and install Ara Broker Tradeskills and you will notice, that the setting is ignored.

	I	Backdrop Texture, reported by Nevyr28/mdss, 1.04.10
		- Since 3.3.3 dropped i've been getting a bleeding effect on my backdrop. It'll skin the very top of the frame and then blend the backdrop down the rest of the frame. This is with a custom backdrop and the Blizzard ones as well.
