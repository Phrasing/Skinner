	O	Major overhaul of skinning code
		-- Need to add functionality to get LibSharedMedia callbacks and apply them to the relevant objects
		-- also need to apply any colour changes selected by the user
		-- and any backdrop/background changes

	O	Update WoWAce commands page

	I	Usability issues, reported by TaliaMokani, 23.08.10
≈		- I have to reload my UI to see every change I make with Skinner, not just the ones that state "require UI reload". This makes testing and tweaking a very long and painful process.
			- Update commands page for changes requiring a Reload
			- Change code to reduce the number of Reloads required if possible

	I	Ghostly artifacts, reported by Kerecha, 13.10.10
?		- Getting some buggy ghost graphics from buttons (the x button from toastframe for instance has a buggy border always showing even when the frame isn't there) the info popup about pallys holypower also generates them.
		- If NOT using UIButton skinning, what can be done about this ?

?	I	PendingInvites, reported by gamemaster128, 16.10.10
		- I have to disable Skinner in order to accept pending RealID friend requests.

x	I	tomQuest2, reported by X-buZZ, 17.10.10
		- i am having trouble with TomQuest2 since the 4.01 updates of Skinner:
			It is not possible to set the quest trackers border and the background to 0% opacity.
			I have tried to set tq2 to disabled in the skinner config but it does not change anything.

?	I	Background Textures, reported by QuackersEQ, 18.10.10
		-	The textures aren't loading in with skinner that i added from kgpanels, the options are still there but they aren't showing up since the patch
		- I added the textures thru kgpanel as .tga paths, and as soon as i did, they have the drop down in skinners list w/ blizzard out of control...etc bliz options along with the textures i added to kgpanels...they used to work before patch and now don't ...http://tinypic.com/r/2h31k4i/7....this is how looked before patch and now its empty, no border, no pics behind her....but the options for those textures are still in my drop down menu... i didn't change anything, they just don't show up when picked now...

	I	reported by skyggesang, 20.10.10
		- I have a number of issues to report this time. When I shift-click to compare items or mouseover a comparable item in the auction house, the tooltip for my equipped item has a blindingly white background making it difficult to read as you can see in this picture. The same thing happens when I click a linked item in chat (picture) for the first time after logging in to a character or reloading my UI.

x		- Also, on the bottom-most action bar, the buttons are not showing if I do not have an ability, item, macro or profession shortcut in them as seen here.
√		- Also in the same picture on the top right hand side, the shaman totem bar (moved via MoveAnything) is not skinning at all.

		And finally a request. I don't know if this was covered in the raid updates for v. b4.13164.5 and I am just missing the option, but if not, would you mind skinning both of the default raid frames shown in this picture
√		- compact raid frames (move from UnitFrames)
		 and the role check as shown in this picture.
√		- RolePollPopup

x	I	ArkInventory, reported by chrisgriffith25, 22.10.10
		- I updated to the latest version of skinner and the bags still aren't being skinned with the appropriate border in arkinventory.  If i don't apply skinner the bags take the border, but when I apply skinner the default to a blurred blizzard boarder.  I'm not getting any errors
