√	I	Calendar, reported by finalflame01, 28.10.12
		- Maybe I'm going crazy, but prior to 5.0 I thought Skinner was fully skinning the in-game calender.  Now it only skins part of it, leaving each day looking like the default blizzard skin.  Is this a bug or intended, and is there a way to skin each day?
