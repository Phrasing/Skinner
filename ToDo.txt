	I	Frames overlaying text, reported by several posters
		- maybe add an option to force frames to use applySkin instead of addSkinFrame ?
?		- is it caused by an addon "re-layering" frames ?

√	I	IceHud, reported by ndnjon, 20.01.10
		-  In the IceHud configuration tab there is a section called "Module Settings' with a drop down menu.  I was trying to move my Rune Bar but while Skinner was loaded, it would only show a blank area, and there was no way to access the drop down
?		- Uses Waterfall for GUI config, maybe has UI buttons checked but no Waterfall skin

?	I	tomQuest2, reported by Craxziz, 21.01.10
		- Using Skinner Version: b2.11159.4 and tomQuest2 3.3 beta 5, with the questwatch skinning option turned off and the tomQuest2 skin loaded, I'm getting gradual but cumulative FPS loss.

		FPS loss occurs when quest objectives update, quests complete and are handed in, exiting combat and also from  changing zones. When doing dailies over the course of about 20 minutes my ooc fps will drop from ~60fps to a constant <20fps, with probable freezes when the above events happen. This effect occurs gradually overtime as the above actions happen. However when in combat with tomQuest2's quest tracker hidden my fps returns to normal.

		With the tomQuest2 skin removed from the skinme directory there are no fps issues.
