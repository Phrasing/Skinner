	O	Frame Borders à la Beautycase, requested by gamemaster128, 11.03.10
		- Is there a way to get Skinner to create borders the way in which !Beautycase makes them? Maybe even using its CreateBorder function?

≈	I	LFG/LFD, reported by Alcotraz, 23.04.10/5.06.10
		- cooldownFrame saying 'you recently queued for a random dungeon.... time left mm Min ss Secs', is behind the LFD panel instead of on top of it

	I 	StatusBars, reported by Oakayam, 15.05.10
		- I have a weird issue. Skinner doesn't change statusbar texture from default Blizzard to custom one from Shared Media. I can see all my textures in dropdown menu. I tried relogging and exiting the game. In the settings the texture is set correctly but statusbars are not being skinned. I use 11723.8. I had this issue with 11723.2 ( I updated from it today ).
