≈	O	Check to see which skins can be obsoleted (ongoing)

≈	O	Look into using LSM callbacks to change media and LSM default media as defaults

√	O	Remove local tables only used for arrays

	O	Review Function Hooks
		- Blizzard skins function hooks
		- Addon skins function hooks

	O	Status Bars
√		- Change glazing code to only create a texture and not another status bar
√		- use existing textures wherever possible
√		- handle extra textures, e.g. FillBar/Flash
√		- make sure they are all updated when texture is changed

	N	PTR 0.3.3.11599
		- StatusBars look odd, partial bar(s) being displayed
√			- XP bar especially (changed code, seems to fix it for the moment)
?			- Nameplate bar texture changes from UI-StatusBar to UI-Targetingframe-BarFill 64 --> 512 width
				this causes the display to look odd

	I	Frames overlaying text, reported by several posters
		- maybe add an option to force frames to use applySkin instead of addSkinFrame ?
?		- is it caused by an addon "re-layering" frames ?

?	I	TipTac/Skinner, reported by shine2009, 15.02.10
