√	S	RicoMiniMap, requested by Kuzah, 13.03.09
	
√	N	Factionizer, reported by pompachomp, 14.03.09
		- The factionizer skin looks a bit weird, looks like there's overlapping text
		
√	I	Border texture not being remembered, reported by Kuzah, 15.03.09
		
√	I	Some libs should not be stripped, reported by gregory2, 15.03.09
		- LibStub, CallbackHandler, LibDataBroker, LibDBIcon & LibBetterBlizzOptions
		
√	I	Off-centered value on PVP panel, reported by Kuzah, 15.03.09
		
√	I	Dominos, reported by HunterZ, 15.03.09
		- So Skinner is making action bar #1 be missing on login/reloadui if you are using Dominos and are on a Druid who was logged out in bear/cat/tree form. Disabling the Dominos skin in Skinner has no effect. Disabling Skinner causes the problem to stop.
