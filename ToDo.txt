√	N	WIM, reported by ToxicGhoul, 26.10.14
		-  The new update works great. I am, however, having an issue with skinner and WIM. I disabled the skin for WIM but left WIM_Options unchecked, because I do want to skin the options. Unfortunately, this removes the skin for the options even though I told it not to. I modified the lua file to skin the options but NOT the chat windows, and it works.
