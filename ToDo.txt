	S	Buttons, reported by Hobbbbit, 20.10.09
√		- Guild Control -> Cancel (old)
√		– Guild Control -> "+" (old)
√		– QuestLog -> "+"/"-" (broken)
√		– PvP -> Arena Team info -> "Add Member" and ">" (old)
√		– Everything inside Interface->AddOns (as already mentioned) including "+"/"-" on the addon list.
√		– Reputation -> "+"/"-" (look very strange when using Skinner Border Texture)
√		– Skills -> "+"/"-" (same as above)
x		– Guild -> ">" (old) next to player status
x		– Spellbook -> "<" and ">" (old)
x		– Skill -> Unlern profession button (old)
		– Bags/Keys -> Close button "x" (old) (not sure about that one, it could be Bagnon)
x		– Mini-map -> Close button "x" (old) (that's probably fine. Skinned button would look funny there anyways).
x		– Calendar -> "<"/">" (old)
x		– Merchant Interface -> "<"/">" (old)
x		– Browse Auctions -> "<"/">" (old)

		- It seems that all of the "<" ">" buttons are using old texture, that's probably because their texture is a bit different from the rest of buttons. Same with scrollbar buttons as well... Not a big deal anyways.
