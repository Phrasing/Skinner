	O	Frame Borders à la Beautycase, requested by gamemaster128, 11.03.10
		- Is there a way to get Skinner to create borders the way in which !Beautycase makes them? Maybe even using its CreateBorder function?

	I	Backdrop Texture, reported by Nevyr28/mdss/BlackDespondency, 1.04.10/20.04.10
		- Since 3.3.3 dropped i've been getting a bleeding effect on my backdrop. It'll skin the very top of the frame and then blend the backdrop down the rest of the frame. This is with a custom backdrop and the Blizzard ones as well.

	I	tradeskill/guild bank/talent frame, reported by Akk1, 30.04.10

√	I	XLoot, reported by Kerecha, 26.04.10
		- Having a small issue with the xloot monitor skin.	The first item looted shows a white background, the rest gets skinned properly with my choose texture as background. This "error" appears each time the monitor is displayed. (ie if i loot a few items and then loot more before the old ones has faded from timeout the new items will display normally, but if the list fades completely the next item looted will be partially skinned again)

√	I	FreierGeist_InstanceTime, reported by Josaline, 7.05.10
