		- I'm running into this odd problem using libDropDown and ArkInventory.
 		libDropDown skins properly (ldd in the skinme dir) however if ArkInventory is enabled (with or without its skinme component) the rawhook to libDropDown's OpenAce3Menu never fires, although Skinner.initialized.LibDropdown == true
