	I	Viewport, reported by pwnpallythemultiboxer, 18.01.20
√		- After the new patch came out, everytime a ingame cutscene has ended, the viewport goes away / turns off, by this i mean:
		All i have to do is to go to the skinner settings... modules.... then viewport.... then uncheck "viewport show", then check it again (and the viewport works as normal again).
