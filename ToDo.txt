√	I	Backdrop textures, reported by MegaManJuno, 4.08.10
		- Just wanted to check if the backdrop tiling issues have been addressed yet? I recently tried reapplying a texture I used to use and still seem to have the same issues that were reported a few pages back, where it will tile properly horizontally, but vertically it seems to only use the bottom row of pixels from the texture, resulting in a "smear" look.
		
√	I	LFD, reported by dwarven,  8.08.10
		- Not sure whether this is a healbot or skinner issue but here goes, I have my Healbot lefthand side of the UI, basically where the original party frames would display, whenever I open the random dungeon panel it appears behind Healbot, any other panel ie character / talents/ profession open correctly over the top of Healbot. Any thoughts?
