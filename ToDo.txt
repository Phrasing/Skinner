√	I	GuildUI, reported by Baiya, 22.07.11
		- I have a minor problem with the skin of the guildroster. If you klick on a member, you get a small window where you have some info on that char and as (guildleader or officer) beneath "rank" a dropdown menu where you can promote or demote someone. The text in that line is there 2 times and overlapping.
