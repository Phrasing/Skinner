√	I	VehicleMenuBar, reported by jh032008, 29.05.09
		- There's an issue with the Blizzard vehicle UI and Skinner. When the bar changes while still on a vehicle, like changing modes in the bomber daily quest in Icecrown or moving to the kill phase in the dragon wrestling daily in Storm Peaks, the vehicle bar starts to slide off screen each time the bar changes. After about three changes, it's completely off the screen.
