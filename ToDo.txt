	O	Major overhaul of skinning code
		-- Need to add functionality to get LibSharedMedia callbacks and apply them to the relevant objects
		-- also need to apply any colour changes selected by the user
		-- and any backdrop/background changes

	O	Update WoWAce commands page

	I	Usability issues, reported by TaliaMokani, 23.08.10
≈		- I have to reload my UI to see every change I make with Skinner, not just the ones that state "require UI reload". This makes testing and tweaking a very long and painful process.
			- Update commands page for changes requiring a Reload
			- Change code to reduce the number of Reloads required if possible

	I	Ghostly artifacts, reported by Kerecha, 13.10.10
?		- Getting some buggy ghost graphics from buttons (the x button from toastframe for instance has a buggy border always showing even when the frame isn't there) the info popup about pallys holypower also generates them.
		- If NOT using UIButton skinning, what can be done about this ?

?	I	PendingInvites, reported by gamemaster128, 16.10.10
		- I have to disable Skinner in order to accept pending RealID friend requests.

x	I	tomQuest2, reported by X-buZZ, 17.10.10
		- i am having trouble with TomQuest2 since the 4.01 updates of Skinner:
			It is not possible to set the quest trackers border and the background to 0% opacity.
			I have tried to set tq2 to disabled in the skinner config but it does not change anything.

	I	reported by skyggesang, 20.10.10
		- I have a number of issues to report this time. When I shift-click to compare items or mouseover a comparable item in the auction house, the tooltip for my equipped item has a blindingly white background making it difficult to read as you can see in this picture. The same thing happens when I click a linked item in chat (picture) for the first time after logging in to a character or reloading my UI.

x	I	ArkInventory, reported by chrisgriffith25, 22.10.10
		- I updated to the latest version of skinner and the bags still aren't being skinned with the appropriate border in arkinventory.  If i don't apply skinner the bags take the border, but when I apply skinner the default to a blurred blizzard boarder.  I'm not getting any errors
