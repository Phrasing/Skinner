	O	Frame Borders à la Beautycase, requested by gamemaster128, 11.03.10
		- Is there a way to get Skinner to create borders the way in which !Beautycase makes them? Maybe even using its CreateBorder function?

	I	Backdrop Texture, reported by Nevyr28/mdss/BlackDespondency, 1.04.10/20.04.10
		- Since 3.3.3 dropped i've been getting a bleeding effect on my backdrop. It'll skin the very top of the frame and then blend the backdrop down the rest of the frame. This is with a custom backdrop and the Blizzard ones as well.

√	I	DocsUI_Nameplates, reported by Seajewel, 13.05.10
		- don't skin nameplates if loaded

	I 	StatusBars, reported by Oakayam, 15.05.10
		- I have a weird issue. Skinner doesn't change statusbar texture from default Blizzard to custom one from Shared Media. I can see all my textures in dropdown menu. I tried relogging and exiting the game. In the settings the texture is set correctly but statusbars are not being skinned. I use 11723.8. I had this issue with 11723.2 ( I updated from it today ).

x	I	XLoot, reported by spAnser, 18.05.10
		- I use xloot and it says the skin was recently updated but now the xloot borders are showing back up even though my skinner settings don't use a border and now it doesn't match everything else anymore.
