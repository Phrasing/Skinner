	I	XLootMonitor, reported by DarkLimpan, 02.07.12
		- I'm having a weird issue between Skinner and XlootMonitor. With my normal Skinner-settings, the XlootMonitor loot list has a white background making it a bit hard to see. If I were to move my savedvariable-files for skinner out of the wtf-folder, then it's black and just fine. Except the rest of my UI just looks ugly.
