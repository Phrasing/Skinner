≈	I	AtlasLoot, reported by Curace, 15.12.11
		- Hello, it seems that atlasloot might have changed something on their side but since their last update the semi-transparent overlay that would show over the atlas map is completely transparent for me, it makes it hard to see the loot depending which dungeon bosses you are looking at.
