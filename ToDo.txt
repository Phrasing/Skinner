?	I	reported by Thrassivoulos, 02.02.16
		- I open skinners options and I check 'skin minimap buttons'. Buttons are skinned but when I log out and in again they are not. I open options again , uncheck and checking again 'skin minimap buttons' , and buttons are skinned again until I relog and so on. This happens mostly with default buttons as calendar, missions table etc , some addons buttons are skinned all the time.

?	I	Minimap buttons, reported by leprecaun13, 27.02.15
		- For the option to skin minimap buttons, while enabled the LFG green "eye" will be hidden until after a /reload
