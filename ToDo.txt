≈	I	Stuttering & lag with tooltip mods, reported by xavier2k3/Loads, 14.05.09

≈	I	Gradient settings lost, reported by doriginal1, 14.05.09
		- lost after .5 released

≈	O	Lag occurring since version b2.9835.3
		- on mouseover, possibly caused by TipTop tooltip addon

≈	I	More lag/FPS reports from Curse

√	I	Move LibQTip skin code into its own skin file

	I	TipTac, reported by MegaManJuno, 5.06.09
		- I seem to be having issues with TipTac stretching my custom background texture applied by Skinner instead of tiling it on login.  Seems if I go into the Skinner options and change the tooltip skinning option from 2 and back again, that it will stay tiled until next login.

	I	LilSparksWorkshop
