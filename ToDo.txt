	I	IOF Buttons
		- are being skinned twice on some panels (AceGUI ones ?)
		- issue is with buttons that have been 'flowed'
		- reused AceGUI buttons sometimes still have a frame when they become check buttons

	I	reported by Excitor0, 15.10.12
		- Gradient doesn't completely fill frames/tabs etc

?	I	Bagnon, reported by Luckyjack_SL, 18.06.13
		- ..\AddOns\Skinner\SkinMe\Bagnon.lua line 73: script ran too long

?	I	BonusLoot, reported by Excitor0, 03.07.13
		- The window that asks you to use a coin for bonus loot is not skinned

√	I	Prat3, reported by DarkLimpan, 07.06.13
		- prat3's editbox ("Skinner User Background") skinning isn't skinned, and it forgets everytime I log out. However, when I change it to "Skinner User Backdrop" (on line 17), it works fine.
		Do you know if this is just me being dumb somehow? Or is it something that haven't been reported before now?

?	I	WIM, reported by NeoZeus, 07.06.13
		- I'm guessing the bugfix for Sexymap is for the white background. It worked, but now for some reason the background is transparent.
		Btw, I am having the same the white background problem with the window that pops up when you get a message in WIM.
