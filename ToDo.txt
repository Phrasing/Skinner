	I 	StatusBars, reported by Oakayam, 15.05.10
		- I have a weird issue. Skinner doesn't change statusbar texture from default Blizzard to custom one from Shared Media. I can see all my textures in dropdown menu. I tried relogging and exiting the game. In the settings the texture is set correctly but statusbars are not being skinned. I use 11723.8. I had this issue with 11723.2
