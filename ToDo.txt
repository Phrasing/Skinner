	I	Frames overlaying text, reported by several posters
		- maybe add an option to force frames to use applySkin instead of addSkinFrame ?
?		- is it caused by an addon "re-layering" frames ?

	N	tomQuest2, reported by gagou, 29.01.10
		- Just to inform you that since a few alpha tomQuest2 is no more using LibQTip for ldb tooltips and trackers. I've replaced it with three frames of my own named:
		tomQuest2QuestsTooltip
		tomQuest2QuestsTracker
		tomQuest2AchievementsTracker

√	O	Test changes to AddonFrames code dealing with loading specified addons safely

√	I	Outfitter, reported by sixthepaladin, 9.02.10

?	I	StaticPopups, reported by ichik, 9.02.10
		- tekAccept - With Skinner this does nothing, no errors are shown, but this snippet seems to have no access to popup.
		If i get invite while loading to world all goes smooth (i guess that is the time when popups are not skinned actually).
		Furthermore: using of AcceptGroup() and StaticPop_Hide seems not helping too.
		The popup stays on screen requiring manual input to close it
