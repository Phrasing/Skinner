	I	Usability issues, reported by TaliaMokani, 23.08.10
≈		- I have to reload my UI to see every change I make with Skinner, not just the ones that state "require UI reload". This makes testing and tweaking a very long and painful process.
		- Change code to reduce the number of Reloads required if possible ?
