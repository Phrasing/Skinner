?	I	Toast frame, reported by Excitor0, 14.09.12
		- The fading in the battle.net toast when skinned seems off.
		- The gradient seems a bit too steep making it look a bit took round and 3d. I think a more flat gradiet for the battle.net toast would look a lot sleeker and better, maybe an option?

?	I 	TradeWindow, reported by Excitor0, 15.09.12
		- Trade window skinning is bugged

?	I	Battlefield Minimap, reported by hammer2, 16.09.12
		- need to be selected each time before it gets skinned
