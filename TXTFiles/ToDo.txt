			- self.bColour to self.bClr
			- self.bbColour to self.bbClr

≈		O	Add checks for Button state as required

≈		O	Refactor NewSkinFuncs in AddOn skins

≈		O	Refactor frame children loops to use Utility function 'scanChildren' via callback

#174 √	I   UIFrames_Retail, attempt to call global 'skinABBtn' (a nil value)

#176 √	I 	Baganator, GuildBank

#177 	I 	AddOn 'Skinner' tried to call the protected function 'CastSpellByID()'
			- Clicking on the Mythic+ Portal/Spell icon causes the error

#178	O 	add easier custom textures
			- Is there a possibility of adding the ability to add more custom textures for backgrounds, borders, or buttons?
			- An easier way to add those would be phenomenal.
			- A way to add pixel borders without using a texture (which doesn’t always scale nicely) would be great, too.
